Welcome to the Calgary/Canterbury text compression corpus.  This corpus is usedin the book	Bell, T.C., Cleary, J.G. and Witten, I.H. Text compression.	Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990and in the survey paper	Bell, T.C., Witten, I.H. and Cleary, J.G. "Modeling for text	compression," Computing Surveys 21(4): 557-591; December 1989,to evaluate the practical performance of various text compression schemes.Several other researchers are now using the corpus to evaluate text compressionschemes.Nine different types of text are represented, and to confirm that theperformance of schemes is consistent for any given type, many of the types havemore than one representative.  Normal English, both fiction and non-fiction, isrepresented by two books and papers (labeled book1, book2, paper1, paper2,paper3, paper4, paper5, paper6).  More unusual styles of English writing arefound in a bibliography (bib) and a batch of unedited news articles (news).Three computer programs represent artificial languages (progc, progl, progp).A transcript of a terminal session (trans) is included to indicate the increasein speed that could be achieved by applying compression to a slow line to aterminal.  All of the files mentioned so far use ASCII encoding.  Somenon-ASCII files are also included: two files of executable code (obj1, obj2),some geophysical data (geo), and a bit-map black and white picture (pic).  Thefile geo is particularly difficult to compress because it contains a wide rangeof data values, while the file pic is highly compressible because of largeamounts of white space in the picture, represented by long runs of zeros.More details of the individual texts are given in the book mentioned above.Both book and paper give the results of compression experiments on these texts.The corpus itself constitutes files bib, book1, book2, geo, news, obj1, obj2,paper1, paper2, paper3, paper4, paper5, paper6, pic, progc, progl, progp andtrans.  (The book and paper above do not give results for files paper3, paper4,paper5 or paper6.)The directory "index" contains the sizes of the files and some informationabout where they came from.Ian H.
